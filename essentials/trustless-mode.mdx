## Introduction to Trustless Mode

Klyra's Trustless Mode provides end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) content moderation, allowing you to moderate sensitive content without ever exposing the plaintext to Klyra's servers. This zero-knowledge approach ensures maximum privacy and security for applications where data confidentiality is critical.

<Info>
  Trustless Mode is available on Business and Enterprise plans. [Contact us](mailto:sales@klyra.io) to enable this feature.

## How Trustless Mode Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Client-side encryption">
    Your application encrypts the content using a locally generated encryption key before sending it to Klyra.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Encrypted processing">
    Klyra processes the encrypted content using secure multi-party computation (MPC) and homomorphic encryption techniques.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Encrypted results">
    Moderation results are encrypted and sent back to your application.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Client-side decryption">
    Your application decrypts the results using the original encryption key.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Technical Implementation

### Step 1: Generate an encryption key

<CodeGroup>
```js JavaScript
import { KlyraClient } from '@klyra/sdk';
import { generateTrustlessKey } from '@klyra/crypto';

// Generate a secure encryption key
const encryptionKey = await generateTrustlessKey();

// Store this key securely - it never leaves your application
console.log('Encryption Key:', encryptionKey);
```

```python Python
from klyra import KlyraClient
from klyra.crypto import generate_trustless_key

# Generate a secure encryption key
encryption_key = generate_trustless_key()

# Store this key securely - it never leaves your application
print(f"Encryption Key: {encryption_key}")
```
</CodeGroup>

### Step 2: Initialize the client with Trustless Mode

<CodeGroup>
```js JavaScript
// Initialize Klyra client with trustless mode enabled
const klyra = new KlyraClient({
  apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
  trustless: {
    enabled: true,
    encryptionKey: encryptionKey
  }
});
```

```python Python
# Initialize Klyra client with trustless mode enabled
client = KlyraClient(
    api_key="YOUR_API_KEY",
    trustless={
        "enabled": True,
        "encryption_key": encryption_key
    }
)
```
</CodeGroup>

### Step 3: Use the API as normal

The SDK handles all encryption and decryption automatically. Use the API as you normally would:

<CodeGroup>
```js JavaScript
// The content will be encrypted automatically before sending
const result = await klyra.moderateText({
  content: "This is sensitive content that will be encrypted",
  settings: {
    categories: ["toxic", "harassment"]
  }
});

console.log(result);
```

```python Python
# The content will be encrypted automatically before sending
result = client.moderate_text(
    content="This is sensitive content that will be encrypted",
    settings={
        "categories": ["toxic", "harassment"]
    }
)

print(result)
```
</CodeGroup>

## Technical Details

### Encryption Specification

- **Encryption algorithm**: AES-256-GCM with HKDF key derivation
- **Key generation**: Client-side CSPRNG with 256-bit entropy
- **Secure computation**: Homomorphic encryption for specific moderation tasks
- **Zero knowledge proofs**: Used to validate results without revealing content

### Security Guarantees

- Content is encrypted before leaving your application
- Encryption keys never leave your system
- Klyra's servers never see plaintext content
- Moderation results are verifiable without decryption
- Full forward secrecy with per-request nonces

## Limitations

While Trustless Mode provides maximum privacy, there are some limitations:

1. **Model accuracy**: Some moderation tasks may have slightly reduced accuracy compared to non-encrypted processing
2. **Performance**: Processing encrypted content takes approximately 1.5-2x longer
3. **Content types**: Currently available for text and image moderation only
4. **Language support**: Full support for English, with partial support for other languages

## Verification and Audit

Klyra's Trustless Mode implementation has been independently audited by security firms:

- [TrustGuard Audit Report](https://klyra.io/audits/trustguard-2023.pdf)
- [SecureCrypt Review](https://klyra.io/audits/securecrypt-2023.pdf)

The client-side encryption libraries are open source and available for inspection:

## Enterprise Options

Enterprise customers can benefit from additional Trustless Mode features:

- Hardware Security Module (HSM) integration
- Bring Your Own Key (BYOK) support
- On-premise deployment options
- Custom encryption schemes
- Additional auditing and logging capabilities
