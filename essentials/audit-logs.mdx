## Accessing Audit Logs

### Via Dashboard

You can access Audit Logs directly in the Klyra Dashboard:

1. Log in to the [Klyra Dashboard](https://dashboard.klyra.io)
2. Navigate to **Project Settings** > **Audit Logs**
3. Use the filters to narrow down the logs by date, event type, user, etc.
4. Click on any log entry to view its details

### Via API

You can also access Audit Logs programmatically through our API:

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -X GET "https://api.klyra.io/v1/audit-logs" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "start_time": "2023-06-01T00:00:00Z",
    "end_time": "2023-06-30T23:59:59Z",
    "event_types": ["moderation.created", "moderation.updated"],
    "limit": 100
  }'
```

```js JavaScript
import { KlyraClient } from '@klyra/sdk';

const klyra = new KlyraClient('YOUR_API_KEY');

async function fetchAuditLogs() {
  const logs = await klyra.auditLogs.list({
    startTime: '2023-06-01T00:00:00Z',
    endTime: '2023-06-30T23:59:59Z',
    eventTypes: ['moderation.created', 'moderation.updated'],
    limit: 100
  });
  
  console.log(`Found ${logs.data.length} audit logs`);
  console.log(logs.data);
}

fetchAuditLogs();
```

```python Python
from klyra import KlyraClient
from datetime import datetime, timezone

client = KlyraClient("YOUR_API_KEY")

logs = client.audit_logs.list(
    start_time="2023-06-01T00:00:00Z",
    end_time="2023-06-30T23:59:59Z",
    event_types=["moderation.created", "moderation.updated"],
    limit=100
)

print(f"Found {len(logs.data)} audit logs")
print(logs.data)
```
